1. If there's a classic program in the world of programming, it's '**hello, world!**'.

Type it, compile it, debug any typing errors (if you make them) and run it.
2. Write a program in C that asks for two numbers from the keyboard and tells which one is greater and which one is smaller.
3. Write a program in C that determines whether a year is a leap year or not.
4. Write a program that prints all the even numbers between 1 and a number N entered from the keyboard.
