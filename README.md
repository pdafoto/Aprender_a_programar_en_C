## Part 2: C Language

1. If there's a classic program in the world of programming, it's '**hello, world!**'.
Let's use it to have our first contact with the C compiler.
Type it, compile it, debug any typing errors (if you make them) and run it.

2. Write a program in C that asks for two numbers from the keyboard and tells which one is greater and which one is smaller.

3. Write a program in C that determines whether a year is a leap year or not.

4. Write a program that prints all the even numbers between 1 and a number N entered from the keyboard.

5. Write a C program that, after inputting a series of 10 numbers from the keyboard, tells which is the largest, which is the smallest, and what the average value is.

6. Write a program that finds all the prime numbers between 2 and a number N entered by the user via keyboard.

7. Write a C program that generates random combinations for playing the soccer pool (15 results with the values 1, X, or 2).

8. Write a C version of the secret number game. The computer will choose a random number between 1 and 100. The user will input numbers from the keyboard, and the computer will give hints: "my number is higher" or "my number is lower", until the user guesses correctly. Then the computer will congratulate them and tell them the number of attempts it took to guess the secret number.

9. Write a C program to calculate a worker's salary. A `salary()` function should calculate the money a worker should receive per week, taking as parameters the number of weekly hours worked and the price paid per hour. If they have worked more than 40 hours, the salary for each additional hour is 1.5 times that of conventional hours.
   Also program a `main()` function that uses the `salary()` function to check if its behavior is as expected.

10. Code in C the problem of returning coins from a vending machine. The program will ask for an amount in euros and then calculate which coins the machine should return to complete that amount. For example, if the amount is €1.45, the program's response should be: one €1 coin, two 20 cent coins, and one 5 cent coin.

11. Write a C program that prints an ASCII code table similar to the one you can find on hundreds of internet pages (just type "ASCII table" in any search engine).

12. Implement in C a program that converts numbers of up to 5 digits to their word denomination. For example, if the number 1980 is entered, the program output should be "one thousand nine hundred eighty".

13. Code in C the continuous clock whose algorithm we designed in the exercises of Part One. The user will enter the current time through the keyboard and, from then on, the program will increment that time every second. You will need to investigate how you can make the program pause for one second between iterations.

14. Write a C program that converts any type of information measurement unit (for example, bytes to Kbytes, Mbytes to bits, etc.). The program will ask for a numerical quantity, a source unit, and a destination unit, and will convert from the source unit to the destination unit.

15. Write a C program that converts binary numbers to decimal.

16. Create a C program to calculate a person's age. The program will ask for the user's date of birth and the current date, and will calculate the age in days, taking into account leap years.
